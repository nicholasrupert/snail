# snail
Snail is a tray application that runs in a console, intended to work with a manual tiling window manager. It is called snail because I like snails.

# Absolutely does not work yet, but will this week
# Basically just installs self and reads/parses config file

# To install, run ./install.sh as root
# installs to /usr/local/bin


# for configuration help, see snailrc.example
