# snail
Snail is a tray application that runs in a console, intended to work with a manual tiling window manager. It is called snail because I like snails.

Most apps working on Linux and OpenBSD now: with date, time, battery/ac, cpu temp, fan speed, audio volume/mute, and wifi status. VPN works with mullvad only. Linux requires sensors installed to have cpu/fan.
