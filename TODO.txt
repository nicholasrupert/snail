figure out how to figure out what terminal emulator is being used

add flag for 12 hour time

maybe add option for date format

make the parsing of the config file ignore white space

make the thing


ok so here is the behavior I want.

If you have *no* small applets, then it figures out how wide
the window is in characters, and it displays the ones you want
right to left until the window is out of width, and then it 
doesn't display the rest of the applets.

If you *do* have small applets, these are just single character
blocks that are red, yellow, green, normal color, or blinking red/
yellow for like spooky stuff.


I think that small_applets should be treated as one applet, 
and you use flags or settings or even its own category to
say which small applets you want.

Ok so we have the arrays and hashes and we can check in either direction

run through the priority array

the first one is free

then add a full divider length and the next applet

then check whether there is a time next to a date
