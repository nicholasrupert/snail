figure out how to figure out what terminal emulator is being used

ok so here is the behavior I want.

If you have *no* small applets, then it figures out how wide
the window is in characters, and it displays the ones you want
right to left until the window is out of width, and then it 
doesn't display the rest of the applets.

If you *do* have small applets, these are just single character
blocks that are red, yellow, green, normal color, or blinking red/
yellow for like spooky stuff.


I think that small_applets should be treated as one applet, 
and you use flags or settings or even its own category to
say which small applets you want.

So far, audio volume, wifi status, date, time, and battery_ac work on OpenBSD.

I am trying to make it update only when something changes or when the screen gets resized.
It mostly works, except sometimes when there is no change of info *and* the screen gets shrunk.

Need to let the user pick date divider colors, need to make the colon color in the time work.

Would be nice if the user could separately decide when the year appears in the date.
